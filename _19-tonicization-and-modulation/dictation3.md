### This Week's Audit Material


**Sightreading**

Instead of a prepared warm-up, this week we will have sightreading at the level of Chapters 9-10 of the Rogers/Ottman textbook.

**Prepared Material**

(Material **in bold** is mandatory. Your section professor will select unbolded examples at random during your audit, so please prepare all the material.)

Chapter 15: **15.45,** **15.61,** 15.65, 15.82, **15.88**

In this chapter, we will study strategies for identifying from melodic context where modulation has occurred.

- 15.45: Start in B-flat minor. At m. 3, change to F minor at the 2nd note (=C). Stay in F minor until the end.
- 15.61: Start in C major. At the pickup to m.3, change to G major, remain in G major until the end.
- 15.65: Start in D minor. The last 3 measures of first half are A major. At the double bar, return to D major and stay there until the end.
- 15.82 starts in G major. Do not modulate; call C# *fi*.
- 15.88: Start in D major. At the pickup to line 2, change to A major. At the pickup to double bar, change back to D major. Watch out for the occasional *fi*.
