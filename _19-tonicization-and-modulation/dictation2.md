title: Self-Test -- Root Movement in Secondary Dominants

### Test your theory

Automatic recall of theoretical concepts can make recognition, analysis, and notation quick and easy.

### Quiz yourself

- What is the root movement when the progression goes V-I or V<sup>7</sup>-I in the tonicized key?
- What is the root movement when the progression goes V<sup>6</sup>-I or V6/5-I in the tonicized key? (Clue: consider where the leading tone is in V<sup>6</sup> and V6/5, and how leading tones must resolve.)
- What is the root movement when the progression goes V4/3-I in the tonicized key?
- Extra credit question: why can’t it be V6/4-I???
- What is the root movement when the progression goes V4/2-I<sup>6</sup> in the tonicized key?
- Extra credit question: why can’t it be V4/2-I? (Clue: consider the voice-leading rules of how the dominant seventh chord resolves to the tonic.)

Memorize these rules of root movement in the context of logical voice-leading rules in music theory, and harmonic dictations will be easy for you.
