### This Week's Sight Singing Material

**Instructions**

*Chromatic notes* are defined as pitches outside of the diatonic scale of the current key. For example, in C major, the diatonic pitches are C-D-E-F-G-A-B. If you were to hear an F-sharp (*fi*), you would identify it as a pitch outside of the key.

*Tonicizations* occur when a dominant-tonic progression creates a temporary key center. For example, hearing *fi* can sometimes be interpreted as the *ti* of the dominant chord. It is very common to hear tonicizations of the dominant in the repertoire we are currently studying, and this week's sight singing examples will include some of these.

You may find the chromaticisms in this week's assignment difficult to land on accurately. Try to think of them as "embellishments" of the harmonic notes, i.e. look out for our usual signposts such as the tones of the tonic triad and the dominant triad. The chord tones are the harmonic goals of the phrase, and the chromaticisms are colorful "stepping stones" that get us from one harmonically important note to another. Don't be distracted by an unfamiliar leap -- just focus on the note that the chromatic note goes to.
