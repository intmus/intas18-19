**Warm-Up: Tonicization of the Dominant Key or Relative Major**

{% include download.html title="Tonicization" filename="Unit18Tonicizations.pdf" %}

**Prepared Material**

(Material **in bold** is mandatory. Your section professor will select unbolded examples at random during your audit, so please prepare all the material.)

Chapter 15: **15.10**, 15.12, **15.15**, 15.19, **15.26**, **15.35**, 15.42.

- 15.10: the most difficult thing about this is the large, jagged leaps. Practice by displacing them at the octave, so that the leap becomes a step. Then invert the interval back to Schumann's original and notice how much easier it is now.
- 12: The alternation of duple and triple divisions of the beat is characteristic of Chopin's style. For full points, these rhythms must be performed seamlessly and with absolute cleanliness. Don't be distracted by the use of *di* -- it is just a stepping-stone between *do* and *re* that adds chromatic interest to the line without implying chromatic disruption to the underlying harmony.
- 15.15: The large leaps outline familiar triads and seventh chords. Why not write a Roman numeral analysis below the staff to prompt your memory of the solfege? Be sure to count through the rests (no skipping!), and take care to retain your sense of pitch over the long rests so that you can confidently come in after the rest has ended.
- 15.19: These grace notes are *appoggiaturas*. This means that you should execute them on the beat. For example, perform the eighth-note appoggiatura G and the quarter note F-sharp in m. 1 as two eighth notes. This is typical in the performance practice of repertoire of this era.
- 15.26: Joplin's ragtime style contains many syncopations. It's crucial to give yourself a firm sense of the beat. Conducting is here to help you! Don't drag out the syncopations -- rather, ensure that the syncopations are in "conflict" with the regular beat. 
- 15.35: the use of chromaticism hints at a brief tonicization of the dominant and a progression back from it.
- 15.42: familiarize yourself with Schumannâ€™s chromatic language. This piece is nominally in E-flat, but almost instantly appears to tonicize the dominant. Sing the grace note and the eighth note that comes after it as two sixteenth notes.
