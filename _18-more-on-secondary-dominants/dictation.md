title: Harmony - More on Secondary Dominants

### Building Recognition

In Unit 17, we began to listen to and sing secondary dominants. As we have discussed, a secondary dominant is a chord that uses a dominant-tonic progression to **tonicize** a key that is not the tonic. In other words, it is a “temporary” dominant.

In Aural Skills III, we practiced identifying the commonest chord progressions, such as I-IV-V7-I.

We will continue to build upon the study of voice-leading and harmonic progression, adding new concepts that add color and interest to harmony -- including secondary dominants. 

In the progression below, we add chromatic color to chord IV by preceding it with its secondary dominant, V<sup>7</sup>/IV (pronounced "five seven of four"). Note that when it comes to tonicizing IV, we will always use V<sup>7</sup> -- this is because V/IV would be indistinguishable from the tonic triad.
