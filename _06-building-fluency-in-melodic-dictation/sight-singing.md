## Preparation for Unit 7 Sight Singing

This week, there is no warm-up. Instead, you will be given a sightreading excerpt by your instructor. This excerpt will be easier than this week's Rogers/Ottman prepared excerpts. 

What to expect: you will be given a tonic triad, a starting pitch, and about a minute to prepare, during which you may sing (the instructor will not listen to or grade you on your preparations). Please sing the excerpt using solfege and conducting yourself. The grading criteria will be the same as the rubric used for regular audit material. 

### Tips for Success:

- During your practice minute, actually practice. Students who typically do well in sightreading are the ones who give themselves a chance to make noise, so that when they must sing "for real," it's their second time through -- the second time is always better than the first! 
- As always, take careful note of the key signature and time signature. 
- Scan the entire excerpt, looking out for tones of the tonic and dominant triads. Which tones are *do, mi*, and *sol*? How about *sol, ti*, and *re*?
- Take careful note of anything that might be challenging, such as an unexpected leap. What are the solfege syllables associated with that leap? Knowing how the intervals work takes the difficulty out of navigating your way from note to note.

### Rogers/Ottman exercises

**6.16**, **6.20**, 6.27. 6.28, 6.29, 6.37, 6.41, 6.48, **6.59**, 6.61, 6.62, 6.64 

### Guidelines for Rogers/Ottman exercises

This is the first chapter to feature melodies in both major and minor, so you should be able to determine the key of an excerpt before singing it. Generally, this depends on three factors:

1. The pitch center: if the key signature has no flats and sharps, for example, does the melody hover around C or around A?

2. Accidentals: look for the raised 6th and 7th degrees, which are a dead giveaway that you're in a minor key.

3. The last note of the piece... while not all melodies end on *do*, enough of them do to make this worthwhile if you aren't sure whether you're in a major key or its relative minor.

In 6.59, conduct in 3 (i.e. the 8th note is the beat note).
