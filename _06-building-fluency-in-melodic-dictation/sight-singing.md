### Sight Singing Instructions

**Sightreading**
The coming week's sight singing lesson will feature sightreading. The difficulty level will be approximately that of melodies we were studying back in Unit 3 and Unit 4. Your instructor will give you a moment to practice the sightreading before you perform it. As always, take careful note of the clef, the key signature, the time signature, and so on. What is the beat note? How many beats are in the measure? Where are *do*, *mi*, and *sol*, and other "signposts"? How is the beat divided? Sing and conduct confidently, aiming for a steady tempo, fluent solfege, and perfect intonation.

**Prepared Examples: melodies with tones from the tonic and dominant triads; major and minor keys; simple and compound meter**
By now, you should have the solfege of the tonic and dominant triads – *do-mi-sol* and *sol-ti-re* – firmly committed to memory. This week’s melodies will feature tones from chords I and V (our tonic and dominant triads), illustrating that we can gauge the implied harmony of a melody even when no harmonic line is present.
