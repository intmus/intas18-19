### This Week's Audit Material

**Warm-Up**

Click on the link below to download the warm-up, "Metric Modulation"
{% include download.html title="Metric Modulation" filename="Unit23MetricModulation.pdf" %}

Metric modulation is defined as a change in tempo (i.e. pulse rate) *and/or* the subdivision (i.e. the grouping) which is derived from a note value or a note grouping heard before the change.

You will need to write on this warm-up and show it to your section professor before performing it to make sure you have done the math correctly. It is *not* hard, but it requires some thought and some multiplication.

- Beginning = 80 to the quarter note. How would we measure the half note beat? (Hint - divide 80 by 2!)
- m. 3 - remember, those tripletized quarter notes are a division of the half note. What is one of them worth? (Hint - multiply the half note tempo marking by 3!)
- Line 2 - When we write "half note = dotted half note," that means the beat remains the same. Therefore, one "normal" quarter note is the same as one of the tripletized ones from the previous measure. Congratulations, you've metrically modulated! Write in the new tempo marking.
- Going into line 3 - four of those tripletized eighth notes are now equal to one of the quarter nots at line 3, measure 1. Therefore, the new quarter note marking will be the old one divided by three quarters.
- Quintuplets! Each one of them fits into a half note. Divide the marking you just wrote for the quarter note to get the marking for the half note.
- Line 4 - we will now divide a half note into some interesting subdivisions. Can you count to 7? Hint - most people can't. A septuplet may be best expressed "in your mind's ear" as "one-two-one-two-one-two-three" or "one-two-three-one-two-one-two."
- Penultimate line: The first two measures actually sound the same but are notated differently. What does that mean for the tempo marking?
- Penultimate line, measure 3 - the eighth note stays the same. Therefore, to find the tempo marking for the dotted quarter, you should first find the tempo marking for the eighth note. Multiply the marking for the half note by 7 to get that. Then divide that number by 3 to get the dotted quarter note marking.
- Penultimate line, last two measures: the beat is the same. What does that mean for the performance of the triplets? (Hint - they aren't faster!)
- Last line, mm. 1-2 - be careful! The quarter note is the same!!
- Last line, mm. 2-3 - the beat does not change, but the division of it does.
- Last line, last measure: if the previous dotted quarter note is equal to the quarter note in this measure, do the two measures sound the same?

**Prepared Material**

Rogers/Ottman - All examples are in bold this week.
**17.3, 17.4, 17.5, 17.6, 17.7, 17.13, 17.18, 17.25, 17.32, 17.33**
- Two different procedures for what happens when we change meter in the middle of a phrase.
- 17.3 through 17.6: keep beat note constant, i.e. the eighth note will remain the same even when the meter changes. Practice these examples by setting your metronome on an eighth note.
- 17.7, the procedure will change: beat that remains constant; length of eighth notes will change. 7.7a and 17.7b actually sound the same.
- 17.13: keep beat constant. However, now you must alternate between beating in 4 and beating in 2.
- 17.18 fluctuates without notice between 6/8 and 9/8.
- 17.24 through 17.27 introduce "irregular" time signatures of 5 and 7. Conduct 5/8 and 5/4 examples in two as directed above the staff. For example, when it says "3+2," conduct in two with a long first beat and short second beat, i.e. "ONE-and-a-TWO-and." Conduct the 7/8 and 7/4 examples in three or in two if you prefer. For example, you can conduct 17.26 in three by counting "ONE-and-a-TWO-and-THREE-and," or conduct it in two by counting "ONE-and-a-TWO-ee-and-a."
- Melodic examples: 17.32 is in a modal folk style (take special care over the solfege "la" and "te" in mm. 5-6). Quarter beat is constant.
- 17.33 is a duet--when the line splits in two at the end, take the upper part. The meter is 3/4 OR 2/4 and changes without notice, so write the conductor's beats if necessary. Modulates to E minor for 2 measures in line 3. Then back to G.




(Material **in bold** is mandatory. Your section professor will select unbolded examples at random during your audit, so please prepare all the material.)
