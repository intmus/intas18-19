### Preparation for Unit 11 Sight Singing

Please click on the link below to access the sight singing assignment for next week. You must bring the assignment to your sight singing lesson. You may choose to print it out, or to view it on a laptop or tablet device. **Please do not attempt to read the assignment from your phone in the lesson. This seldom results in a high score.**

### Instructions
 **Sightreading**
 Please follow the instructions for previous weeks. The sightreading will be of the approximate difficulty level of examples we studied 2-3 weeks ago.

 **Prepared Examples**
 - Rhythm
 This unit’s sight singing examples will include more complicated rhythms, including double dotting. This rhythmic concept is very common in music of the French Baroque, including in French Overture form. Composers such as Jean-Baptiste Lully pioneered this form, which ended up influencing later composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach. As you know, adding a second dot to a dotted note adds the value of half the first dot. Therefore, careful subdivision is crucial to success. 
- Melody: This unit’s material will also include more difficult leaps within the melodic line. As always, find a way – using your knowledge of scales and chords, for example – to create an intermediary step that will guide you from one note to the next.
