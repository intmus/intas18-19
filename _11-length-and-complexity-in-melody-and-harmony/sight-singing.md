## Preparation for Unit 12 Sight Singing

### Sight-Reading

Instead of a warm-up, this week you will be given a short excerpt to sightread. You will be given around a minute to prepare yourself using the usual strategies (what is the clef? Time signature? Key signature? Can you find tonic and dominant triadic patterns? Is there anything unusual in there that you might stumble over?)

The difficulty of this excerpt will be roughly that of the difficulty of chapters 10-11 of the Rogers/Ottman textbook.

### Rogers/Ottman Exercises

12.11, 12.20, 12.21, 12.23, 12.29, 12.37, 12.39, 12.59 

### Guidelines for Rogers/Ottman Exercises

- These melodies are more difficult than previous ones in the book. Take time to prepare!
- 12.11: The original melody is actually in 2, not in 4. Please take take at a reasonably fast tempo; otherwise, you won't capture the character of the music.
- 12.37: This melody starts with a minor 9th. Practice initially as a minor 2nd, then expand beyond an octave.
