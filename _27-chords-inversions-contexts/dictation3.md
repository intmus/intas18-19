- This week we will sing the familiar modal scales using a method of identifying the intervallic relations of the pitches that may be unfamiliar. We will sing each scale as two **tetrachords** (collections of four notes) that are spelled using **pitch class sets.** This term simply refers to a collection of notes that we identify using numbers from 0-11 -- that is, each note of the chromatic scale is assigned a number. Therefore, if C is "0," "1" will be a half-step above C -- C-sharp or D-flat (either spelling is OK). 
- How to sing the warm-up: sing the first tetrachord, then the interval that separates it from the second tetrachord. Lastly, sing the second tetrachord. Therefore, the Ionian scale will be sung like this: "0, 2, 4, 5, whole step; 0, 2, 4, 5."
