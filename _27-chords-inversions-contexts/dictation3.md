- This week we will sing the familiar modal scales using a method of identifying the intervallic relations of the pitches that may be unfamiliar. We will sing each scale as two **tetrachords** (collections of four notes) that are spelled using **pitch class sets.** This term simply refers to a collection of notes that we identify using numbers from 0-11 -- that is, each note of the chromatic scale is assigned a number. Therefore, if C is "0," "1" will be a half-step above C -- C-sharp or D-flat (either spelling is OK). 
- How to sing the warm-up: sing the first tetrachord, then the interval that separates it from the second tetrachord. Lastly, sing the second tetrachord. Therefore, the Ionian scale will be sung like this: "0, 2, 4, 5, whole step; 0, 2, 4, 5."

**Prepared Material**

Rogers/Ottman Chapter 20: **20.14, 20.15,** 20.17, 20.19, 20.29, **20.34, 20.36**

- 20.14: The key signature is E minor, and we're clearly in Aeolian mode. Be sure to pay attention to the 6th and 7th scale degrees, because they're not *la* and *ti*...
- 20.15: Though the key signature is E major, the phrases tend to begin and/or end on B. It may therefore be easier to sing this example in B Mixolydian, i.e. to call B *do*. 
- 20.17: This example is in the key signature of E-flat major, but you'll note the presence of *fi* (A natural) throughout. That's a pretty strong indicator that we should sing this one in E-flat Lydian.
- 20.19: The key signature is in E minor. However, you can choose whether to sing this example in E Aeolian *or* B Phrygian. In some ways, though this might seem unlikely, B Phrygian can actually be easier!
- 20.29: This excerpt, which is in G Dorian, is an example of the "prima prattica" style that signaled the end of the Renaissance and beginning of the Baroque era. That means that it's essentially pre-diatonic music. Take careful notice of the *musica ficta* above the staff. The way this is reproduced in your textbook is a modern way of notating a much older practice of writing accidentals. **Please note that the accidentals in this example don't last until the next barline -- they are for the designated pitch only.**
- 20.34: There is no key signature, but sing this one in D Phrygian.
- 20.36: Sing in G Dorian.
