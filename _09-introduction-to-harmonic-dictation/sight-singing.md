### Rogers/Ottman Exercises

9.6, **9.13**, 9.18-19, 9.24, **9.30**, 9.31-32, 9.35, **9.36**

### Guidelines for Rogers/Ottman Exercises

- 9.6: what key is this in? Analyze carefully! Conduct in a very slow 4. Dynamics and phrasing are important. Can you find the V7 arpeggio?
- 9:13: in one as marked.
- 9:18 Breathe in the proper places, not within slurs. In the first measure of line 2, breathe after the second note, as a new phrase (parallel to the beginning starts after this.
- 9:19: Prepare to sing as a canon.
- 9:24: Watch the C-sharp in measure 2; it doesn't continue the arpeggio set up in measure 1.
- Section 4: Devote plenty of time to preparing these melodies, as they are the most difficult ones in the book so far.
