### The Logic of Chord Progressions

In diatonic music, chords progress according to the highly rational, consistent rules of voice-leading. Therefore, harmonic dictations in this class will conform to the following rules of chord progression.

In major keys, chords progress like this:

![Chord Progressions in Major]({{ '/images/Week9MajorProgression.jpg' | relative_url }}){:target='_blank'}

In minor keys, chords progress like this:

![Chord Progressions in Minor]({{ '/images/Week9MinorProgression.jpg' | relative_url }}){:target='_blank'}

If you commit these rules to memory, it will help you avoid analysis errors.
