**Prepared Material**

Rogers/Ottman textbook Chapter 16: 16.10, **16.14**, 16.15, **16.16**, 16.17, 16.29, **16.30**.

- 16.10: Start in G-flat major. 2nd line 3rd measure: change to E-flat minor. 3rd line 1st measure 2nd beat: change to D-flat major. Last 2 phrases: G-flat major.
- 16.14: In this example, there is no modulation, but there are difficulties including chromatic neighbor tones, rhythmic complexity, etc. Count the measure of rest!
- 16.15: Be aware that Schumann abruptly changes key at new phrases. Begin in B minor. Line 2, pickup to 2nd measure: change to G major. At the *ritardando*, change to B minor. Line 4, pickup to 3rd measure, change to D major. At the *ritardando*, change to B minor and stay there until the end.
- 16.16: Begin in B-flat major. Pickup to line 2: change to F major. 2 pickups to line 3: change to B-flat major again until the end. This example is much easier if you look at the outlined triads, i.e. sol-ti-re etc.
- 16.17: Begin in G major. Line 3 measure 3 2nd note: change to D major. Line 5: change to A minor. Line 6 4th measure: change to G major, stay there until the end.
- 16.29: Begin in F-sharp major, no modulation. Although it doesn't modulate, there are some difficulties: for example, switching between duple and triple division of the beat. Pay careful attention to the chromatic notes in practice: *mi/me, sol/se,* etc.
- 16.30: Begin in F-sharp major, changing to C-sharp major at Fine. Only return to F# at the *da capo.*

(Material **in bold** is mandatory. Your section professor will select unbolded examples at random during your audit, so please prepare all the material.)
