### Sight Singing Assignment

{% include download.html title="Unit 21 Sight Singing Assignment" filename="Unit21SSA.pdf" %}

**Warm-Up Instructions**

This week's warm-up explores modulations to closely related keys. A close relation is one that either shares a key signature, or does not differ by more than one sharp or flat. The first example in the warm-up is in a major key, and progresses through vi, IV, and V. The second example is in a minor key. It progresses through III (the relative major), iv, and V. At the asterisk, change your solfege to that of the new key.

**Melodic Solos and Duets**

In the last sight singing assignment, we studied melodies in major keys that modulated to the dominant. In this assignment, we will study melodies in *minor* keys that modulate to the relative major. Where asterixes are marked, change your solfege.

**Playlist of Modulating Melodies**

Please listen to the playlist in full. Try to pinpoint the moment at which the modulations take place. For extra enrichment, try writing down some of the melodies.
