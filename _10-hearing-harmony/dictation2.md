title: Ear Training - Systematic Listening in Harmonic Dictation

Here is an example of the type of three-chord progression we will study this week.

**Systematic Steps**

1. **Big-picture listening:** "I'm listening to the overall color of the progression. _All the chords sound like major triads._" Remember this, it's important.
2. **Bass note possibilities:** "Now I'm focusing my listening on the bass voice. Sounds like *do-re-mi*. *Do* in the bass? Probably chord I. *Re* in the bass? Could be chord ii... Wait, chord V also has *re* in it... To have *re* as the bass note, it would have to be in second inversion -- V <sup>6/4</sup>. *Mi*? The most likely explanation is chord I<sup>6</sup>. Because _it's not chord iii._ Chord iii is very unlikely, plus, it's a minor chord and I already established all the chords were major triads."
3. **Chordal analysis using logic:** "If the third chord in the progression is I<sup>6</sup>, then the second chord in the progression can't be chord ii, because ii can't go to I." (Why not? See the table of chord progressions in Unit 9.)
4. **Soprano notes and confirmation of hypotheses:** "I hear *mi-re-do.* That makes sense, because *mi* is part of I, *re* is part of V 6/4, and *do* is part of I<sup>6</sup>." (Theory behind this: the "passing 6/4" that we see in the above example is one of three very specific uses of the second inversion triad. We'll get to the other two -- pedal and cadential -- in due course.)
5. **Use final hearing to check work.** "Are my analyses consisten with the pitches I've notated?" "Are my chord identifications consistent with the rules about chord progressions?"
