title: Ear Training - What to Expect in Harmonic Dictation
---

### Philosophy

Harmonic dictations draw upon the elements you have already mastered in Units 1-8 of this course: melodic and harmonic intervals, major and minor scales, triads, and seventh chords. Now we will use these elements in harmonic -- and melodic -- context by analyzing chords and notating melodic lines. Harmonic dictation is *not* difficult, as long as you approach it in a logical systematic way.

### Procedures 

In harmonic dictations, the instructor will play a chord progression in four voices (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) on the piano. **Chord progressions will conform to the rules of chord progression as outlined in Unit 9, and will model the principles of voice-leading that you are concurrently studying in theory.** 

The instructor will play the progression four times: the first time equally voiced, the second time with the bass note accented, the third time with the soprano note accented, and the fourth time equally voiced. The first bass note and soprano note will be given. You will notate the missing bass and soprano notes and supply a Roman numeral and figured bass analysis under the staff.

Review the principles of chord progression and root movement from Unit 9. Commit these rules to memory, because they will help when you are trying to work out your analysis.

### Tips for Success

- As always, take careful note of the key signature. Look at the given soprano and bass pitches and notice which solfege syllables would be assigned to them in the given key.
- In the first hearing, listen carefully for colors. What chord progression is it? If unsure, use the first hearing to take note of the chord qualities. This alone will tell you a lot.
- On the second hearing, focus on getting your bass notes written. Bass notes are the strongest predictor of chord quality and inversion. Jot down some notes on possible analyses.
- On the third hearing, write the soprano notes and use them to confirm your analysis. For example, a soprano note can help you to confirm whether a chord is IV or ii<sup>6</sup>.
- On the final hearing, check your work for errors.
