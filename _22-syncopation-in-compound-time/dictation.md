title: Rhythmic Dictation -- Reviewing Compound Time

### Reviewing Compound Time

Back in Unit 7, we studied the principles of rhythmic dictation in compound time. As you know, **the definition of compound time is that the beat is divisible by three**. Therefore, the beat note will be a dotted note -- and in this class may be a dotted sixteenth, eighth, quarter, half, or whole note. 

### Review of the Principles from Aural Skills III

(Please review Unit 7 for the full version.)

When we first began rhythmic dictations in compound time, we studied the following methods for success:

**The "Back to Basics" Method**

- How many beats are in the measure? (i.e. 6/8 has 2, 9/8 has 3, 12/8 has 4, etc.)
- What is the beat note? (Take careful note of this, because you must get it right to get points. If the time signature is 6/4 and you write an otherwise "correct" rhythm but in 6/8, you'll get 0 points.) 
- What are the possible divisions and subdivisions of the beat? (Remember, the beat is divisible by three...) 

**The "Dummy Rhythm" (Error Detection) Method**

- Error detection is easier than writing "from scratch." Therefore, you may find it useful to write a "dummy rhythm" under or above the staff to keep yourself on track. For example, in 6/8 time, it can be useful to use "quarter, eighth." Sometimes the rhythm may be correct, or partially correct.

**The "Forwards and Backwards" Method**

- Most of us can't write as fast as the speed of the instructor's delivery. Therefore, so that you don't run out of time, it can be worthwhile to write the first few note values in "real time," then simply listen without writing until the end of the dictation. The last few note values will be fresh in your mind, so write them down in the silence between hearings. Next hearing, try to add a little more from the beginning and the end until you meet in the middle. This method can help you avoid blank spaces.
