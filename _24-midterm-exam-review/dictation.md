### This Week's Audit Material

**Sightreading**

You will be given a sightreading example of approximately the difficulty of Rogers/Ottman chapter 12.

**Prepared Examples**

Rogers/Ottman Chapter 17. **17.37**, 17.47, **17.51, 17.58,** 17.64, **17.67,** 17.73.

- 17.37: The *beat* remains constant. Therefore, the eighth note divisions of the beat will change depending on whether the division of the beat is duple or triple. Take careful note that the rhythm of m. 6 (2+2+2) is different from that in m. 7 (2+3+1). For full points, rhythm must be perfect.
- 17.47: Contains many syncopations, which must be performed accurately against a steady conducted beat. Start in e minor. m. 5, high E: modulate to b minor (fa of the new key). m. 9 (after the double bar): back to e minor. Conduct and count through the rests. m. 13: b minor for four measures. Last 4 measures: back to e minor.
- 17.51: Conduct in 1. (It is OK to practice this in a quick 3, but ultimately the tempo is so fast that it's better to conduct in 1.) Notice the *hemiola* in the last line -- equivalent to a "big 3." This is why it's best to conduct in 1...
- 17.58: Conduct in 2, that is, a big 1 and small 2 ("One and a two and"). Most metronomes and metronome apps have a 3+2 function, so try practicing with it. No modulations.
- 17.64: Conduct the 5/8 in 2 ("one and a two and"). Start D-flat major. Line 2, measure 2: f minor. Pickup toline 3: back to D-flat major until the end. Conduct the penultimate measure in 3. 
- 17.67: Conduct the 7/4 in a big 3 ("one and a two and three and"). No modulations.  
- 17.73: Conduct the "5+3" as two big unequal beats ("one-two-three-four-five / one-two-three"). No modulation, but take care over solfege in m. 9 (half-diminished 7 chord).
