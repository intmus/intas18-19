This material builds on the rhythmic concepts we studied last week. Conducting and singing in unfamiliar meters can be perplexing for first-time learners, so set yourself up for success by practicing with conducting and rhythm only a few times while you accustom yourself to how it feels to conduct in irregular patterns. 

Next, try practicing with conducting and chanting solfege. That is, you'll say the solfege syllables without attempting a pitch. Last of all, add the pitches in. Some of the melodies in this material were composed in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, when the concept of diatonicism was being pushed to its utmost limits. Therefore, the melodies will not contain as many triadic "signposts" as, for example, a melody by Mozart.
