- Right now: Bring your **EarMaster voucher** with your name and Vandal email address written on it, together with your receipt from the Vandal Bookstore, to Dr. Wilson so that you can be entered into the system. Can’t find Dr. Wilson? Put it in her mailbox in the main office.
- Tonight: **Check your Vandal email** to find out which section of Aural Skills III you have been placed in (Dr. Wilson, Dr. Sweeney, or Dr. Rodriguez).
- Tonight: **Add/drop** in VandalWeb so that you are in the correct section of Aural Skills III.
- Before Thursday 8/29: Study for our **first quiz** on the major and three minor scales (natural, harmonic, melodic), which will take place Thursday morning at 9:30 a.m.
- Thursday 8/29: Bring your **schedule** to class so that you can book your **weekly sight singing lesson** with your section professor. Once this appointment is made, treat it as a permanent commitment and don’t schedule anything that conflicts with it.
