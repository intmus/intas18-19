title: New Material - Compound Seventh Chords
---

Previously, we studied the identification of compound triads. We learned how intervallic relations provide crucial evidence in identifying both chord quality and inversions.

We will use the same procedures for identifying compound seventh chords. To do so, please memorize the following table, which provides a handy reference guide for quickly identifying chord qualities -- and eliminating incorrect answers.

 | fully diminished (dd) | half diminished (dm) | minor-minor (mm) | major-minor (Mm) | major-major (MM) 
tritones? | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 
P5 *or* P4? | no | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 
type of 7th? | diminished | minor | minor | minor | major
