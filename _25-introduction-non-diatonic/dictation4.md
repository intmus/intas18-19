We have already studied rhythmic concepts such as "two against three" and "three against four." In this warm-up, we will add "two against five" and "three against five."

Polyrhythms are *not* difficult if you figure them out using a little easy math. 
- First, figure out what the two numbers have in common. For two against three, that number is six, because 2+2+2=6 and 3+3=6. 
- Use that common number as your subdivision. Therefore, for two against three, subdivide the measure in six: "One-and-two-AND-three-and" will help you divide three into two, wherease "One-and-A-two-AND-a" will divide two into three.
- Some people find mnemonic devices useful in internalizing the "global rhythm" of the polyrhythm. For example, "Nice cup of tea" (quarter, eighth, eighth, quarter) is a commonly-used mnemonic device for two against three.

**Prepared Material**

Ottman/Rogers Chapter 18: 18.6, **18.8, 18.11,** 18.13, **18.23**, 18.27, **18.29**, 18.34

- 6: pay close attention to the double dotting 
- 8: conduct in 2
- 11: conduct in 4. For full points, you must perform this with no stops!
- 13: conduct in 6
- 23: conduct in a subdivided 4, very slow tempo. M. 5 modulates to E-flat; m. 7 back to C minor.
- 27: conduct in a subdivided 4. Line 5 m. 3: modulates to D. At the 3 pickups to the DS, modulate to G major.
- 29: conduct in 6, no modulation.
- 34: conduct in a subdivided 4.
