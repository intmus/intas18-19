### Next Week's Audit Material

**Sightreading**

Instead of a warm-up, we will have sightreading at the approximate difficulty level of Rogers/Ottman Chapter 13.

**Prepared Material**

Rogers/Ottman Chapter 19: 19.2, 19.4, **19.9, 19.18, 19.33**, 19.39, **19.52**

- 19.2: use of chromatic tones. Modulation to c minor occurs at line 5, m. 2; go back to E-flat major line 6, m. 2. Last line: 1st 2 measures in c minor, last 2 measures in E-flat major. 
- 19.4: doesn’t modulate, but extensive use of chromatic tones. 
- 19.9: no modulation, but beware of Brahms’s penchant for chromaticisms. e.g. *ri-mi*, *li-ti-do*, etc. 
- 19.18: in this duet, be prepared to sing either part (you may be asked to sing this twice, once on each part). NB you MUST practice with a study buddy or you will find this too hard! It is not hard once you understand how the parts fit together. For full points, you must keep going at all costs. Hesitation loses points!
- 19.33 Very chromatic use of circle of 5ths. Modulations: m. 4 is in D minor; m. 5 is in C minor, m. 6 is in G minor, m. 7 is D minor; m. 8 is G minor. To prepare, sing the vocal line against the continuo’s bassline to understand how this works. Then take away the bassline, but keep it in “your mind’s ear” to keep your orientation of pitch and harmony.
- 19.39: One of Schubert’s characteristic harmonic turnarounds to a far-flung key. Langsam=slow. Conduct in a slow 2. C minor until line 3 measure 2: at the *mf* marking, call this E major. Last 2 measures (start at pickup to penultimate measure): C minor again.
19.52: In this duet, be prepared to sing either part. Home key = A flat. Modulation occurs line 2, measure 3: call this E major. Last 3 measures: modulates to E-flat.
