### This Week's Audit Material

**Warm-Up**

This week's warm-up will be sightreading at the level of Rogers/Ottman chapter 8. You will be given a tonic triad and a minute's preparation. Be sure to rehearse the usual parameters -- meter, rhythm, melody, solfege, conducting -- before you perform.

**Prepared Material**

(Material **in bold** is mandatory. Your section professor will select unbolded examples at random during your audit, so please prepare all the material.)

14.4, 14.5, **14.7**, 14.14, **14.15**, 14.22, 14.27, **14.32**, 14.42, 14.43, **14.49**

- Practice tips for rhythm: 4 and 5 are easy. 
- 14 contains varying divisions and subdivisions. Prepare them carefully. 
- 15 is more difficult. Think very critically about how you will perform 2 against 3. 
- 27: this contains varying divisions of the beat. Make sure your conducting is very strong so that you can easily switch between duple, triple, *and* quadruple divisions of the beat.
- 32 (duet): practice with a partner. For full points, this must be executed very cleanly.
- 43: this example contains relatively simple solfege, but puts this week's rhythms into practice in a melodic context. If you struggle with the rhythm, practice that on its own a few times before adding pitch and solfege.
- 49: for best results, change the way you count the division of the beat during the long rests. For example, count measure 5 "One-and-a-two-and-a" (i.e. articulating two sets of quarter note triplets). When you get to measure 6, four of those tripletized quarter notes will "go into" the whole note and two of them will go into the half note.
