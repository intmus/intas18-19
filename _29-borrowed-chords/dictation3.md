### Next Week's Audit Material

**Warm-Up**

{% include download.html title="Twelve-Tone Rows" filename="Unit29TwelveTone.pdf" %}

This week's warm-up is drawn from the sixth movement of Alban Berg's *Lyric Suite*, a piece constructed using twelve-tone serialism. You may not be familiar with the style, so listen to the sixth movement first. (Get inspired and listen to all of it! Then Google the intriguing story of forbidden love that inspired the composition...)

You'll hear the two rows we're studying quite clearly in the cello and viola pizzicato at the beginning. If you follow carefully, you'll hear the intervallic relations from the row as Berg transforms it using inversion, retrograde, and so on.

In this warm-up, we will sing through the rows interval by interval. By now, you've practiced so much interval singing that you should be able to sing any ascending or descending interval with ease. When singing this kind of non-diatonic music, you may feel free to enharmonically respell notes to make the intervals seem easier.

**Prepared Material**

Chapter 21: **21.49**, 21.52, **21.60, 21.63**, 21.64
- 21.49 (Stravinsky): this is based on an octatonic scale (sing the octatonic scale first to get into the right mindset). The first six measures only make use of four pitches, so this is much easier than it looks. Pay special attention to intonation in the last two measures.
- 21.52 (Rimsky-Korsakov): this excerpt is octatonic, but gives the appearance of being (almost) diatonic. However, unlike diatonic music, it “oscillates” between C and F#, meaning you have to sing the same material a tritone apart. Tip: get really good at tritones!
- 21.60 (Schoenberg): This is “free atonality,” a style Schoenberg used in the period before developing twelve-tone serialism. The melody is mostly in half steps, perfect fourths, and perfect fifths. Practice each interval on its own first for fluency. Please note: unusually for atonal music, this piece has a key signature! Feel free to respell some notes enharmonically to make getting from note to note easier: e.g. in the last note of measure 4, if you think of the pitch as C-sharp rather than D-flat, then you can sing a perfect fifth going into the downbeat.
- 21.63 (Stravinsky, *Le sacre du printemps*): this is based on only five pitches, that is, B-B-sharp-D-flat-D-sharp-E, and is much easier than it looks. Conduct the 3/16 and 2/16 bars in one. Conduct the 2/8 bars in 2. Conduct the 5/16 bars in 2 (you may decide whether 2+3 or 3+2). Most students will want practice the rhythm by itself first before attempting to perform rhythm, pitch, and conducting simultaneously.
- 21.64 (Stravinsky *Elegy*): this is from Stravinsky's last period, when he started composing in the twelve-tone technique (a thing he only began after the death of Schoenberg). Practice this excerpt intervallically first, using the method from the warm-up.
