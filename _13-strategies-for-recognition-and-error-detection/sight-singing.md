## Preparation for Unit 14 Sight Singing

### Sight-Reading 5

Instead of a warm-up, this week you will be given a short excerpt to sightread. You will be given around a minute to prepare yourself using the usual strategies (what is the clef? Time signature? Key signature? Can you find tonic and dominant triadic patterns? Is there anything unusual in there that you might stumble over?)

The difficulty of this excerpt will be roughly that of the difficulty of chapters 10-11 of the Rogers/Ottman textbook.

### Rogers/Ottman Exercises

Rogers/Ottman: 13.83, **13.89**, 13.110, 13.114, **13.115, 13.117,** 13.118

### Rogers/Ottman Guidelines

- 13.83: donâ€™t drag the syncopations
- 13.110: Some dotted figures, some Scottish snaps, take care to be accurate
- 13.114 and 115: these come from non-Classical repertoire. Take note of the different styles.
- 13.117: prepare the arpeggiated syncopated patterns carefully.
- 13.118: this contains syncopations and large leaps, both of which require careful preparation.
