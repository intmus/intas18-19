# Rhythmic Dictation

This week, we will review the simple time signatures. When writing down rhythmic dictations, try to establish a sense of the pulse, remembering what your beat note is. Not all beat notes are quarter notes! For example, if the time signature is 4/8, the beat note is an eighth note.

Please review the following simple time signatures: 2/2, 3/2, 4/2; 2/4, 3/4, 4/4; 2/8, 3/8, 4/8; 2/16, 3/16, 4/16. Questions to ask: what is the beat note? What are all the possible divisions and subdivisions of the beat?

Part of learning rhythm successfully is knowing what a rhythm *sounds* like and what a rhythm *looks* like on paper. For practice, think about the rhythm of a well-known piece of music such as "The Star-Spangled Banner" or "America the Beautiful." Try writing down the rhythm from memory, then look up the score on a Google image search to see if you were correct.
