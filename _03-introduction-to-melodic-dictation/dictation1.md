## Introduction to Harmonic Intervals

Harmonic intervals are called this because they are part of chords that appear in diatonic harmony. We can find all the simple intervals between the notes of diatonic scales, and by extension, chords. Practice these piano workouts that stress the intervallic properties of familiar chords.

### Perfect and Imperfect Consonances

The *perfect consonances* (perfect fourths, perfect fifths, perfect octaves) and the *imperfect consonances* (major thirds, minor sixths, minor thirds, major sixths) can all be found within the tones of the major triad and its inversions.

### Dissonances Contained Within the Tones of the Dominant Seventh Chord and Its Inversions

The major-minor 7 chord (V7 in diatonic harmony) contains two dissonances: the diminished fifth and the minor seventh. In inversions, we can hear the major second (which is the inversion of the minor seventh) and the augmented fourth (which is the inversion of the diminished fifth).

### Dissonances Contained Within the Tones of the Major-Major Seventh Chord and Its Inversions

The major-major 7 chord (MM7) provides the extreme dissonance of the major seventh and its inverse, the minor second. (Notice, too, the way perfect consonances appear in this workout.)
