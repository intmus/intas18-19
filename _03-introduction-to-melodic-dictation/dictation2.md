#Introduction to Melodic Dictation

Melodic dictation can seem daunting at first, but it’s not as hard as it looks. Remember that the examples we will study in this class are both *repetitive* and *predictable*. This is not a bad thing. If you know what to expect, you can make educated guesses even if you aren't sure of the answer.

## Things all the melodic dictations this week will do:

- They will outline the tones of the tonic (I) triad, *do-mi-sol*, at the beginning of the phrase, and usually at the end too. This is how a melody establishes a key and implies a cadence.
- They will very likely outline tones from the dominant (V) triad, *sol-ti-re*, too. A variant of this chord is, of course, V7: *sol-ti-re-fa*. 
- One type of phrase structure is the *sentence*, which is composed of a basic idea, a repetition — exact or inexact — of that idea, the continuation/fragmentation of that idea, plus an implied perfect or imperfect authentic cadence.
- Another type of phrase structure is the *period*, which is composed of antecedent-consequent structure, an implied half cadence at the end of the antecedent, and an implied perfect or imperfect authentic cadence at the end of the consequent. We will go over examples of both types of phrase structures in class.

## First steps in practicing melodic dictation:

Listen to the tonic triad. Sing up and down the scale of that key, using solfege. Sing up and down the tonic triad: “Do-mi-sol-mi-do.” On scratch paper, write down which tones correspond to the solfege syllables, i.e. in G major “do-mi-sol” will be G, B, and D.
Once you feel comfortable with the tonic triad, sing the dominant triad: “Sol-ti-re.” In G major, the tones will be D, F-sharp, and A. Remember these, because they will help you get the right notes.

## How NOT to do it:

Don’t “separate out” rhythm and pitch. The rhythms in these examples will not be complicated, and if you waste an entire hearing getting “rhythm only,” you may miss the pitches. Get your pitches in the staff right away.

## Sample melodic dictations:

Most common nursery rhymes and other famous songs do all the repetitive, predictable things mentioned above.

- The well-known song “Hot Cross Buns” has sentence structure. The “mi-re-do” scalar pattern establishes the key and the basic idea. See if you can write it down from memory.

- Another well-known song, “Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush,” has period structure. Its basic idea is built around *do, mi,* and *sol* = the tonic triad. In the contrasting idea, it implies dominant harmony by using the tones of the dominant triad: *sol, ti*, and *re*. The consequent has an exact repeat of the basic idea from measure one, but this time it varies the contrasting idea so that we can have a perfect cadence at the end instead of the half cadence we had before.

## Developing skill outside of class

In your own practice, think of some other well-known songs that fall into predictable melodic patterns: nursery rhymes, folk songs, and so on. Try to write down a song you know well from memory. Then analyze it according to the principles we studied today. Look for tones from the tonic and dominant triads, and for repetitive melodic patterns.

Some suggestions:
“Itsy Bitsy Spider”
“Old McDonald Had a Farm”
“I Saw Three Ships”
