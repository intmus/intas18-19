### Sight Singing Instructions

**Intervals: perfect and imperfect consonances**

All simple intervals may be found within the tones of the diatonic scale. When you first learned simple intervals, you may have found it easiest to relate them to do as you mastered their terminology in relation to each other. Now, we will place them within their commonest melodic and harmonic contexts as they appear in major keys. Please commit these contexts to memory for easy recall.

Interval Name | Solfege (Ascending)
--- | ---
Minor second | *ti, do*
Major second | *do, re*
Minor third | *mi, sol*
Major third | *do, mi*
Perfect fourth | *sol, do*
Augmented fourth | *fa, ti*
Diminished fifth | *ti, fa*
Perfect fifth | *do, sol*
Minor sixth | *mi, do*
Major sixth | *sol, mi*
Minor seventh | *sol, fa*
Major seventh | *do, ti*

**Rhythms: dotted rhythms in simple meters** 

Adding a dot to a note adds half the value again to that note. In professional music-making, itâ€™s very important to be able to perform dotted rhythms crisply. For this reason, you should always practice them with a subdivided metronome to ensure maximum accuracy. You should also ascertain what kind of dotted rhythm you are performing. Does the dotted note cross the beat, divide the beat, or subdivide the beat?
