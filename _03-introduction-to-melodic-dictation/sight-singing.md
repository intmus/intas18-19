## Preparation for Unit 4 Sight Singing

## Warm-Up - Intervals in Context

Download Week 4 Warmup - Intervals in Context

Intervals are some of the fundamental elements of melody and harmony. They have very specific melodic and harmonic contexts, and in Aural Skills III we assign specific solfege to them. Please memorize the solfege syllables assigned in this warm-up because we will use them again and again. Sometimes there is more than one "correct" way to spell an interval using solfege. For example, a minor second can be spelled *ti do* or *mi fa* because that is how it appears in the diatonic scale. Don't be tempted to spell it *do ra* because this is not a common melodic context in diatonic music. For further clarification, please ask your professor and/or TA.

## Rogers/Ottman Exercises

**4.18**, 4.19-23, 4.30, 4.35, **4.46**, 4.50-53, 4.69-4.73, 4.82, 4.84, **4.86** 

The theme of this chapter is compound meter, so make sure to review the difference between compound and simple meter. Almost all of the pieces in compound meter that we will study will be conducted in the BIG beat. For example, conduct 6/8 in 2 (not in 6) and 9/4 in 3 (not in 9).

A good musician always thinks on at least two rhythmic levels simultaneously, and this is especially true in compound meter. For instance, in Rogers/Ottman 4.18, conduct in 4, but feel every eighth note subdivision.
