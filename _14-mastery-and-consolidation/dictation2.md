### The Theory of Harmonic Intervals

In Unit 3, we began work on hearing harmonic intervals as part of easily recognizable chords. In these examples for piano practice, we used all inversions of the major triad, the dominant seventh chord, and the major-major seventh chord to create contexts for the harmonic intervals.

But these chords are not, of course, the only possible chords that we can use. Compose your own piano workout using other kinds of triads and seventh chords and see what you can come up with. Invert the chords, comparing intervals. Try singing them too!
