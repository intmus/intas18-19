title: Ear Training - Mastery of Seventh Chords and Their Inversions
---

In Unit 4, we began our study of five types of seventh chord. Over the subsequent units, we worked on seventh chords in all their inversions. Though seventh chords may initially seem daunting, they are *not* difficult as long as you remember their forms and functions.

### Flow Charts

In Unit 4, we worked with a flow chart to identify seventh chords. At that time, the first question concerned whether you could hear the interval of a second -- the unmistakable sign that a seventh chord is inverted. Now, try to invent your own flow chart for how you will eliminate wrong answers and zero in on right ones. Your first question may vary. Suggestions you can try include:

- Does this chord have dominant function?
- Does this chord have a context in major keys only, minor keys only, or is it found in both major and minor keys?
- Does this chord have a "jazzy" sound?

These are not the only possible first questions! Invent your own and share them with your study buddies.

### Procedures

Remember, everything is easier when you have a procedure. The suggested procedure for correctly identifying and notating seventh chords is as follows:

- First hearing: is the chord inverted or in root position? Listen out for the interval of a minor or major second. (This can sometimes help you identify both the chord quality and inversion on the very first hearing!) Can't hear a second? The chord must be dd<sup>7</sup>, which you may always identify as root position in this class, or another of the seventh chords in root position.
- Second hearing: use your knowledge of function and intervals to determine the chord quality.
- Third hearing: figure out the solfege of the chord you've identified, *as it would appear in root position*. This will help you figure out what key you're in -- and by extension, what accidentals you must notate when you write down the chord. If the chord is inverted, then figure out which solfege is the lowest pitch. Then...
- Fourth hearing: notate the chord carefully, checking solfege and key signatures to eliminate notation errors.
