## Inverting Seventh Chords: Second Inversion

In Unit 4, we studied five different types of seventh chords (dd, dm, mm, Mm, MM) in root position and first inversion.

When we notate chords in inversions using figured bass, we abbreviate the intervallic relationships in the chord from lowest to highest pitch using the following shorthand.

This week we are going to study seventh chords in **second inversion**, which we notate using the abbreviation **4/3**. Please commit the table below to memory for easy recall.

Position  |  Intervallic Relation  |  Abbreviation
---  |  ---  |  --- 
Root Position  |  1-3-5-7 |   7   
First Inversion  |  1-3-5-6  |  6/5   
**Second Inversion**   |   **1-3-4-6**   |   **4/3**   
Third Inversion   |   1-2-4-6   |   4/2   

In other words, every 4/3 chord will be composed of a third between the two lowest pitches, with a second in the middle, and a third stacked on top. The quality of the intervals is determined by the chord quality. Please also memorize the following information:

**function and solfege**   |   vii0 4/3 in minor keys, fa le ti re   |   Usually appears as  chord ii⌀4/3 in minor keys, le do re fa. Also appears as chord vii⌀4/3 in a major key, fa la ti re.   |   Often appears as chord ii4/3 in a major key, la do re fa. Also appears as chord vi4/3 in a major key, mi sol la do.   |   Chord V4/3 in major and minor keys: re fa sol ti   |   sol ti do mi   
**salient features**   |   This chord may appear in 4/3 presentation in music. In this class, always ID it as root position.   |      |   Symmetrical   |      |   Symmetrical   |   Only one of the 4/3 chords to feature a minor 2nd between its middle two pitches.
