### Instructions

Syncopated rhythm can be found in music of all cultures and eras. In genres such as modern Western popular musics, it feels so natural to perform in syncopated rhythm that the sight of the notation can come as a surprise. 

Syncopation is frequently found in music of the Baroque and Classical eras, often in combination with chains of suspensions and resolutions. Another genre in which syncopation is a key rhythmic feature is ragtime. In Scott Joplinâ€™s instructional [*School of Ragtime*](https://imslp.org/wiki/School_of_Ragtime_(Joplin%2C_Scott)), he explains the procedure for learning how to compose and perform syncopations.
