## Preparation for Unit 13 Sight Singing

### Singing Scales With Syncopation

A *syncopation* is defined as a passage that displaces the normal accented beats of the meter, instead stressing a normally non-accented ("weak") beat. In other words, when you perform a syncopation, you must place your articulations in a way that is "off-beat" with your conducting.

In this week's warm-up, you must sing scales syncopating against your own conducting.

### Rogers/Ottman Exercises

13.19, 13.23, 13.30, 13.37, 13.39, **13.49, 13.52,** 13.60, 13.63, **13.69** 

### Guidelines for Rogers/Ottman Exercises

The trick to mastering these rhythm exercises is to practice them repeatedly **with the metronome**. Start slow, and divide the metronome beat to aid your accuracy. For full points, your performance must be absolutely fluent, without stops or hesitations.
