### Reviewing Concepts from Aural Skills III

A syncopated rhythm is defined as a deviation from the flow of the expected rhythmic pattern. A syncopation often places accents or stresses in places where they aren't normally expected to occur.

Syncopated rhythms occur virtually everywhere in popular and dance musics from many cultures. 

There are several types of syncopations.

1. In this example, the syncopation crosses the barline.

2. In the next example, the syncopation happens within the divisions of the beat.

### Tips for success in notating syncopated rhythms

- Internalize the beat. Many people find it helpful to conduct along with their non-writing hand.
- Take careful note of the time signature. What is the beat note? What are the divisions and subdivisions of the beat?
- Use the forwards-and-backwards method: write as much of the beginning as you can in "real time" until you can't keep up, and then when the professor finishes the dictation, write in as much of the end as you can recall. On subsequent hearings, fill in the gaps.
