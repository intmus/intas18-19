title: Compound Triads

### Triads in Context

You are already adept at identifying simple triads in all the inversions. You have also proven that you can identify compound chords in root position and inversions within the context of four-part harmonic dictations in Aural Skills III.

In Aural Skills IV, we will add an extra level of skill to your perception of triads by hearing them outside of a context. Please note that this semester, no notation is required.

** Procedure for identifying compound triads**

1. Identify and write down the chord quality. This should be easy review.
2. Find the root of the chord. For example, if you've identified that the triad is major, focus your hearing on *do*. 
3. Compare the root note you identified with the bass note of the chord. Is it the same pitch class? If not, which note of the triad is it?
4. Analyze the chord accordingly, i.e. *do* in the bass indicates root position, *mi* in the bass indicates M 6/3, *sol* in the bass indicates M 6/4.
