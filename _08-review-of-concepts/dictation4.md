title: Ear Training - Rhythmic Dictation Review
---

Please review all simple and compound time signatures. Remember the definitions of simple and compound time:

- In simple time, the beat is divisible by **two**. Therefore, the beat note will be a note that *doesn't* have a dot on it.
- In compound time, the beat is divisible by **three**. Therefore, the beat note will be a note that *does* have a dot on it.

## Strategies for Success

- Time signatures are one of those concepts that become so automatic that we sometimes don't stop to consider the fundamentals. Questions to ask: how many beats are in the measure? What are the possible divisions of the beat? Simply jotting down these facts can save you from careless errors.
- Having trouble staying on track? Try writing conductor's beats above the staff and conducting with your non-writing hand during the dictation.
- Can't remember what to write? Write *something*, then practice error detection on your next hearing. Error detection is easier than starting from scratch.
- Can't write fast enough to keep up? Try the "forwards and backwards" method. Start at the beginning, write as much as you can before you lose track, then wait until the end of the dictation and get the final note values in before your next hearing.
- Review concepts from Unit 7.
