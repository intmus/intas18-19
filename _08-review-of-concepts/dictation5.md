title: Ear Training - Melodic Dictation Review
---

### Characteristics of Melodic Structures

- You can expect melodic dictations to contain repeating material.
- They will establish the tonic key by including tones from the tonic triad at the beginning and end of the phrase.
- You can also expect tones from the dominant triad.

### Getting Started

- Take note of the clef!
- What is the time signature? How many beats are in the measure? What is the beat note?
- What is the key signature? Ascertain on hearing the tonic triad whether it's major or minor?

### The First Hearing

- Where is the repetitive melodic material? i.e. is there a "basic idea" that repeats exactly or inexactly, followed by a fragmentation, continuation, and cadence? Or does the phrase use period structure with an antecedent and consequent? Noticing repetition of material will prevent you from having to write certain concepts from scratch on every hearing.

### Implied Harmony

- Notice where tones from the tonic and dominant triads occur. What solfege degree does the excerpt start and end on?
