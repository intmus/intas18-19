### Preparation for Unit 9 Sight Singing

Please click on the link below to access the sight singing assignment for next week. You must bring the assignment to your sight singing lesson. You may choose to print it out, or to view it on a laptop or tablet device. **Please do not attempt to read the assignment from your phone in the lesson. This seldom results in a high score.**

### Sight Singing Instructions

**Sightreading**
This week, you will again sight-read a short piece of music. Your professor will give you a tonic triad, a starting pitch, a tempo, and about 60 seconds to prepare yourself.

Please sing the excerpt using solfege, conducting yourself as you sing.

As you prepare, please take note of the following features of the piece:
- What is the time signature?
- What is the key signature?
- Which solfege degree does the piece start and end on?
- Which pitches are *do*, *mi*, and *sol*? Plan around the tonic triad -- it's there to help you.
- Which pitches are *sol*, *ti*, and *re* (the dominant triad)? 
- Look out for unexpected skips, rhythms, or anything else that might take you by surprise.
- Keep your gaze slightly ahead of the note you are singing so that you are ready for what comes next.

Importantly, please don't hesitate to sing during your preparation time. If you prepare out loud, then when you have to sing "for real," it will be your second time through. You will not be graded on any of the sounds you make during the preparation time.

**Prepared Materials - The Dominant Seventh**

The V<sup>7</sup> chord is composed of the dominant triad – *sol ti re* – with the addition of a minor third above it. The solfege is therefore *sol ti re fa*. It is the same for both major and minor keys; when notating it in a minor key, be sure to raise the seventh scale degree to create *ti*.

The function of V<sup>7</sup> is to set up the expectation of a resolution to the tonic triad (or a resolution to the submediant triad in a deceptive cadence).
Though they are both familiar chords, V<sup>7</sup> is different from V because it is a dissonant chord. In fact, it is doubly dissonant: *ti* and *fa* give us a tritone whichever way up you spell them, while *sol* and *fa* give us a minor seventh. In both cases these dissonances need to be resolved. In voice-leading procedure for the V<sup>7</sup>-I progression, *fa* must resolve downwards to step to *mi* (or *me*, in minor keys). *Ti* usually resolves to *do*. 

Take careful notice of the intervals created by the tones of the V<sup>7</sup> chord. Become adept at singing the minor seventh – *sol fa* – and the diminished fifth – *ti fa*.
