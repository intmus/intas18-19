## Preparation for Unit 9 Sight Singing

This week, you will again sight-read a short piece of music instead of having a warm-up. Your professor will give you a tonic triad, a starting pitch, a tempo, and about 60 seconds to prepare yourself.

Please sing the excerpt using solfege, conducting yourself as you sing.

As you prepare, please take note of the following features of the piece:
- What is the time signature?
- What is the key signature?
- Which solfege degree does the piece start and end on?
- Which pitches are *do*, *mi*, and *sol*? Plan around the tonic triad -- it's there to help you.
- Which pitches are *sol*, *ti*, and *re* (the dominant triad)? 
- Look out for unexpected skips, rhythms, or anything else that might take you by surprise.
- Keep your gaze slightly ahead of the note you are singing so that you are ready for what comes next.

Importantly, please don't hesitate to sing during your preparation time. If you prepare out loud, then when you have to sing "for real," it will be your second time through. You will not be graded on any of the sounds you make during the preparation time.

### Rogers/Ottman Exercises

9.6, **9.13**, 9.18-19, 9.24, **9.30**, 9.31, 9.32, 9.35, **9.36**. 

### Rogers/Ottman Guidelines

- 9.6: choose the key carefully! Conduct in a very slow 4. Dynamics and phrasing are important. Can you find the V7 arpeggio?
- 9:13: in one as marked.
- 9:18 Breathe in the proper places, not within slurs. In the first measure of line 2, breathe after the second note, as a new phrase (parallel to the beginning starts after this.
- 9:19: Prepare to sing as a canon.
- 9:24: Watch the C-sharp in measure 2; it doesn't continue the arpeggio set up in measure 1.
- Section 4: Devote plenty of time to preparing these melodies, as they are the most difficult ones in the book so far.
