## Preparation for Unit 8 Sight Singing

This week, you will again sight-read a short piece of music instead of having a warm-up. Your professor will give you a tonic triad, a starting pitch, a tempo, and about 30 seconds to prepare yourself.

Please sing the excerpt using solfege, conducting yourself as you sing.

As you prepare, please take note of the following features of the piece:
- What is the time signature?
- What is the key signature?
- Which solfege degree does the piece start and end on?
- Which pitches are *do*, *mi*, and *sol*? Plan around the tonic triad -- it's there to help you.
- Which pitches are *sol*, *ti*, and *re* (the dominant triad)? 
- Look out for unexpected skips, rhythms, or anything else that might take you by surprise.

Importantly, please don't hesitate to sing during your preparation time. If you prepare out loud, then when you have to sing "for real," it will be your second time through. You will not be graded on any of the sounds you make during the preparation time.

### Rogers/Ottman Exercises

8.4, **8.23**, 8.34, 8.37, 8.43, **8.50**, 8.63, **8.64**, 8.66

### Rogers/Ottman Guidelines

- 8.4: count rests, sing as canon
- 8.23: compound time, many leaps
- 8.34: leaps in m.3, slightly difficult cadence
- 8.37: listen to it in context to understand leaps and tuning of second line.
- 8.43: What is the triad outlined in the first 3 notes???
- 8.50: a bassline. If you arenâ€™t used to these, this can be challenging.
- 8.63-64, 8.66: expect to be given either part.
