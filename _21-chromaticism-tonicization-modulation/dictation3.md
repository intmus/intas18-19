### This Week's Sight Singing Lesson

**Sightreading**

Instead of a warm-up, this week's lesson will feature sightreading. You may expect any of the clefs, key signatures, time signatures, and rhythmic patterns we have studied to date, but there will be no tonicization or modulation. As always, rehearse carefully before you perform for your instructor.

**Prepared Material**

Previously, we studied modulations from tonic to dominant, or from minor keys to relative majors. This week's examples modulate to other related keys. Before you begin, examine the accidentals in the scores. What modulation is implied? At the asterisk, change your solfege to that of the new key.
