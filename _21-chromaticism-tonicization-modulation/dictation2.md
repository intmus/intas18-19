title: Pivots in Melodic Dictations
---

When you identify a modulating melody, the key to ascertaining harmonic movement is to look for a point in the melodic line that contains a **pivot**. This is a note, or collection of notes, that indicates a "turnaround" in the implied harmony towards the new key. 

In many cases, you'll be able to identify the new *do* by its *ti.* Wherever *ti* is found, *do* isn't far away; therefore, the first note you're likely to hear that is outside of the key signature is the *ti* of the new key.

In this example from Schubert's well-known Lied "Heidenr√∂slein," the accidental in measure 6 indicates the shift to C major (the dominant). *Fi* -- a chromaticism in the home key -- indicates the new *ti*.

Things to take away from this: *fi* is not "normal." If you hear *fi* in a dictation, this is a strong clue that you are now hearing *ti* in the new key. *Ti,* of course, is "normal" -- and tells you where *do* will be.
