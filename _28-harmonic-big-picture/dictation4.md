- This week, we will use our new skills in pitch-class sets to use them in singing the non-diatonic scales. Be sure to review singing whole and half steps without solfege!


**Prepared Material**

Rogers/Ottman Chapter 21: **21.5, 21.8, 21.13,** 21.21, 21.43
- 21.5: Conduct in 4 with a long 4th beat. Some may find it helpful to write beats above the staff, using a vertical line for the short beat and a triangle for the long beat. This indicates that the 4th beat is long and is also divisible by 3.
- 21.8: Keep the 8th note constant (i.e. the beat won't be constant).
- 21.13: Sing without solfege. Use the syllable "la." The trick to getting it right is to look out for familiar patterns such as triadic movement.
- 21.21: No solfege. Practice the whole tone scale well before attempting this example. Look for whole tone patterns *and* a few diminished triads. Circle these patterns in your book if this helps you recognize while singing.
- 21.43: No solfege. Look for whole tone patterns.
