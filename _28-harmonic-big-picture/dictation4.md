### Next Week's Sight Singing

{% include download.html title="Unit 29 Sight Singing Assignment" filename="Unit29SSA.pdf" %}

**Warm-Up**

This rhythmic warm-up comes from *Mikrokosmos,* a multi-volume series of progressive piano repertoire by the Hungarian composer B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k. Do not attempt to conduct in eighth notes; instead, conduct in large beats as shown. The beats will have the value of either two or three eight notes. Therefore, conduct 3/8 measures in 1.

**Pitch-Class Sets**

We will use the pitch-class set singing skills developed last week to build non-diatonic scales. Build your scales step by step using these easy, memorable intervallic patterns before attempting entire scales on "la."

**Non-Diatonic Melodies**

Study the intervallic relations of the pitches in these melodies carefully before attempting them. Analyze them according to the principles of the pitch-class sets and scales we have already studied. An analytical understanding makes performance much more manageable. Struggling? Try an exercise where you move from pitch to pitch, isolating each interval until it feels more comfortable. Do this without the given rhythms a few times to strengthen your sense of pitch. Then add back the rhythms now you know the melodic shape better.
