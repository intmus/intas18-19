### Rogers/Ottman Exercises

**5.14,** 5.21, **5.29,** 5.39-40, 5.43, **5.45,** 5.47, 5.48 

This week we will study excerpts in minor keys. In this class, we will use the "textbook" melodic minor scale only, i.e. with the sixth and seventh degrees *la* and *ti* in ascending motion and *le* and *te* in descending motion. If you study jazz, this may be different from the way your teacher instructs you to play melodic minor scales for jazz. In this class, however, we will use the "textbook" version only.

With this in mind, take special care this week in your Rogers/Ottman excerpts over the melodic minor scale. Make sure you distinguish between the raised sixth and seventh (la, ti) and the lowered sixth and seventh (le, te). Be careful: sometimes the "ascending" form will be used in descending motion, for example in 5.43.
